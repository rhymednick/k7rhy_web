# About K7RHY

I'm a US-based amateur radio operator operating on Whidbey Island, WA. I have been a software development professional for over 30 years. I've always been drawn to electronics and embedded systems, so amateur radio was a natrual fit for me. My recent focus has been on user education, so I'm excited to merge my interests here and share my kits and assembly guides with you. 

I've just completed my first kit, the [20W Dummy Load](/DL20W.md), but several more are almost ready for production. 

Coming soon:
* Dummy load with SMA connector
* Dummy load with automatic OLED power output display, and multiple connectors (SMA & BNC)
* Alternate kit form factors

If you have questions or ideas for kits that you'd like to see, send me an email and tell me about it - [de.k7rhy@gmail.com](mailto:de.k7rhy@gmail.com).
